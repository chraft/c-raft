Contributing
=============================

Development: 
Fork the code and submit pull requests for the master branch, once coding standards have been verified you may be given direct commit access.
You need the .NET 4 Framework if you wish to contribute, builds are also compiled against the mono compiler to check compatibility.
Comment your code well, remember that you are not the only one contributing.
Builds are built on each commit and the status output to the IRC channel.

Testing:
Builds are available on request (IRC) but will be made generally available soon.
